    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Heidi, I have 5 beautiful children ages ranging from 18-2.
     One of my favorite hobbies is online gaming, my favorite games are MMO's,
     and my absolutely favorite MMO is an old game called Star Wars Galaxies. I
     currently volunteer as a CSR on an emulator of Star Wars Galaxies (the live
     server shut down about 8 years ago). My oldest brother is a full-stack web developer
     and has been telling me for years that I should get into development. He always believed that I would enjoy it
     and be good at it. Now I really wish I had listened to him back then! Recently
     I discovered that I actually really enjoy coding and the prospect of learning
     is very exciting to me. I am focusing on front-end web development now, but
     would eventually like to learn to develop games as gaming is a passion of mine.
